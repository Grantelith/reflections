When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 In case of data loss and to be able to share the repository with others.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Because each commit does not correspond to one full change so you would have an "incomplete" file, but by manually updating you push files
 that you consider OK for public view.
