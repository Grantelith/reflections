When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 In case of data loss and to be able to share the repository with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Because each commit does not correspond to one full change so you would have an "incomplete" file, but by manually updating you push files
 that you consider OK for public view.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork: Copying repositories on github.
  Clones: Copying repositories from remote to local and local to local.
  Branches: Different copies of the code with different elements each.
  Forks are used when you want to use/alter files from other github users that you do not have permission to alter.
  Clones are used to be able to edit files on your computer (usually when it is code).
  Branches are used when you want to have different versions of your files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 So you can work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Using Dropbox or another cloud service. The only way something would be easier than using github and git would be to work with the collaborator
  on the same workspace. Other than that, it would be extremely hard for multiple people to make changes on the same file, without version-control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 You make changes to other branches when you want an experimental future which you do not know for sure works and you also want your
 collaborator(s)'s opinion on. Whereas, working directly on master makes updating your local and remote branches easier but also
 susceptible to bugs etc.
